1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

> sort - returns data sorted alphabetically by line. uses characters in each line to sort data
  wc - output = "42     107    1005 commands.js" 42 is the count of newline, 107 is the number of words, 1005 is the number of characters in commands.js
  uniq - shows only unique lines from commands.js. repeated lines are filtered out and not included in outpu



2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

>  input = echo testing this data | wc
  output =      1       3      18

  output is wc of "testing this data". it shows 1,3,18 because "testing this data" has 1 line, 3 words and 18 characters



6. In this checkpoint, you encountered built-in JavaScript methods as well as the new ES6 syntax. Review the information below before attempting the programming challenge.

``` js

function reverseWords(inputString) {
  var splitSentence = inputString.split(' ');
  var reversedSentence = [];
  splitSentence.forEach((word) => {
    var splitWord = word.split('')
    var reversedWord = splitWord.reverse();
    var joinedWord = reversedWord.join('');
    reversedSentence.push(joinedWord);
  })
  return reversedSentence.join(' ');
};

```
